# Reaction-Diffusion simulations

This repository contains some Python examples to obtain
reaction-diffusion results and animations as the one shown below.

For an explanation/tutorial, see the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/benmaier/reaction-diffusion/blob/master/gray_scott.ipynb)
and also the one [with animations attached](https://github.com/benmaier/reaction-diffusion/blob/master/gray_scott_with_animations.ipynb).
